### Scientific reproducibility

I am an advocate of open-source software and data sharing. You can
find tools that I've helped to develop at
[provenance@harvard](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/provenance-at-harvard)
and on [Github](https://github.com/provtools).

### Network analysis software

I have helped to code Ecosystem Network Analysis (ENA) algorithms into
the R programming language. These have been integrated into an
open-source software package called
[enaR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/enaR/index.html). Check
out our develop page at https://github.com/SEELab/enaR. 

I've also programmed and hosted a Shiny app for exploring the Pitcher
Plant Microecosystem model. The model lets the user simulate how
oxygen dynamics in the pitcher plant are modulated by ecosystem and
food-web parameters. Check it out here:
https://harvardforest.shinyapps.io/virtualpitcherplant/.


### Genes to ecosystems tools

During my dissertation I worked on a number of coding projects related
to the genes to ecosystem research in the Cottonwood Ecology Lab at
NAU. You can check out the projects at
https://github.com/CommunityGeneticsAnalyses. 

### Computational Tools

*Lanugages*: I am most familiar with **R** but I can also work in
 other functional programming languages such as
 **MatLab**/**Octave** and I have some familiarity with **Python**. I
 also am very comfortable working in **BASH** and to a lesser extent
 in **DOS**.

*Coding*: My primary "IDE" is **Emacs**, which I use in conjunction
  with **ESS**. This is largely a product of often working remotely on
  Unix-esque servers, as this setup allows me to move almost
  seemlessly between systems and maintain a consistent working
  environment with the tools I need, such as language specific syntax
  highlighting.

*Compute*: I have worked on several large compute clusters,
  including Harvard's Odyssey, Indiana University's Mason and Northern
  Arizona University's Hoth server. As such, I now have a working
  knowledge of how to use several job scheduling systems, such as
  **SLURM**.
