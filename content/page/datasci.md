### Scientific reproducibility

I am an advocate of open-source software and data sharing. You can
find tools that I've helped to develop at
[provenance@harvard](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/provenance-at-harvard)
and on [Github](https://github.com/provtools).

### Network analysis software

I have helped to code Ecosystem Network Analysis (ENA) algorithms into
the R programming language. These have been integrated into an
open-source software package called
[enaR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/enaR/index.html). Check
out our develop page at https://github.com/SEELab/enaR. 

I've also programmed and hosted a Shiny app for exploring the Pitcher
Plant Microecosystem model. The model lets the user simulate how
oxygen dynamics in the pitcher plant are modulated by ecosystem and
food-web parameters. Check it out here:

### Genes to ecosystems tools

During my dissertation I worked on a number of coding projects related
to the genes to ecosystem research in the Cottonwood Ecology Lab at
NAU. You can check out the projects at
https://github.com/CommunityGeneticsAnalyses.
