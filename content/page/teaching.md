### Harvard Forest Research Computing Education

While at Harvard Forest I have participated as a mentor and instructor
for the the
[Harvard Forest REU](http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/other-tags/reu)
and the
[School Yard LTER](http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/schoolyard-lter-program)
programs.

### R for Ecologists

I have taught introductory courses for undegrads, graduate students
and professionals at the Northern Arizona University, University of
Bordeaux, University of North Carolina Wilmington and Harvard
Forest. In particular, I emphasize using computational tools to
facilitate open-science and reproducibile research.

### Ecosystem Network Analysis for Ecologists

At the Ecological Society of America meeting, I co-taught a class on
using Ecological Network Analyses (ENA) to analyze network data using
the [enaR](github.com/SEELab/enaR) software package developed for the
R programming language.
