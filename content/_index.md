*I use mathematical and computational, data-driven methods to study the
forces that impact interactions among species in complex
communities. My studies have primarily involved using network theory
and data synthesis to investigate the potential ecological and
evolutionary responses of fungal, insect and food-web interactions. I
also conduct research and do educational outreach for promoting an open
approach to scientific analyses.*
