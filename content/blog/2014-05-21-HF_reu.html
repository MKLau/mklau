<p>I have mentored students in association with the
<a href="http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/other-tags/reu">Harvard Forest Research Experience for Undergraduates</a>
(REU) Program. The REU is an ecology focused opportunity for
undergraduates to get hands-on experience conducting field and
laboratory research.</p>
