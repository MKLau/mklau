<p>I have accepted an invitation to conduct postdoctoral studies at
<a href="http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/">Harvard Forest</a> (Harvard
Univeristy) to continue my research on the impacts of genetic
variation on ecological networks. I’ll be working with
<a href="http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/aaron-ellison">Dr. Aaron Ellison</a>
who has studied the impacts of ecological disturbance on a broad
variety of ecological systems.</p>
