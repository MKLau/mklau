<p>I have been working with Dr. Stuart Borrett’s
<a href="http://people.uncw.edu/borretts/">Systems Ecology and Ecoinformatics Lab</a>
(aka. the SEELab) at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. to
apply and develop computational tools for analyzing complex ecological
networks. Together we have produced the <a href="github.com/SEELab/enaR">enaR</a>
Ecosystem Network Analysis (ENA) package that incorporates over 40
years of research into network analysis algorithms.</p>
