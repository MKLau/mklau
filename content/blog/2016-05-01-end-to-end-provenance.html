<p>Iâ€™ll be joinging a team based at Harvard University
(<a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/computer-science">Computer Science</a> and
<a href="http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/">Harvard Forest</a>) and <a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/">Mount
Holyoke College</a> to work on methods for
capturing and storing information about scientific computations. We
will be focusing on
<a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/provenance-at-harvard">Data Provenance</a>,
which is a formal record of the processes that created a given data
set.</p>
